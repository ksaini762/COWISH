# COWISH
Life is precious, either humans or animals. Then why is the sacred animal left stranded in the middle of nowhere?
Why is the animal once respected as Mother has now become a liability?

To deal with this problem, this is my contribution by coming up with a website that revolves around the issue of stray cattles. This comes under open innovation as this  provides an environment to facilitate rescue of cows by reporting unprotected cattle. This is a sustainable, evergreen model as the cows then source the raw materials for various go-products ,  to improve the condition of cows by providing them shelter, welfare, promoting go products thus limitng market for slaughter industry too.
